Welcome to the SamaCare take home project.

Requirements
The code runs on a web server that I can run locally + access using curl
There is a brief README to guide me through the setup process + how to call your endpoints
Note - the following are behavioral specs. This means you’ll need to take charge of the implementation details and edge cases. For example, one of our specs is allowing publishers to reply to existing tweets, an edge case to address is how to handle it when the API is supplied with an invalid Tweet ID

Step 1
You’re making a new Twitter platform for recently banned users. During your first step, you’ll need to build some of the basic mechanisms. To start, we’ll want to build an API for these users for two different use cases: reading and publishing

A publishing user should be able to
Write new tweets
Reply to existing tweets

A reader user, in a single API call, should be able to
Query all tweets in the system
Query all tweets by a group of publishers
Query all tweets in a specific window of time
Query a tweet and all the responses to this tweet

At a minimum, tweets should have
An ID or UUID
A message (maximum 140 characters)
An author (referring to a user in the user table or collection)
A timestamp

You’ll want to have database entities for users as well

Step 2
Congratulations! You’ve launched at Virtual South by Southwest 2021, and your users love you, but they’re also demanding more features, specifically privacy features

A publishing user now wants
To mark some of their tweets as private, except to their followers
To remove followers

A reader should now be able to
Follow a publisher
Note - they should not be able to re-follow a publisher once removed

Congrats - you’re now the largest social media platform on Market Street in San Francisco
